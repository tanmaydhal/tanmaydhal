"Put your heart, mind and soul into even your smallest acts. This is the secret of success." - Swami Vivekananda

Avid Software Engineer with a curious mind who loves learning and keeping myself updated with the latest technologies in the tech industry! Interested and experienced (2+) in MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js (MERN), JavaScript ES6, HTML5, CSS & Python to name a few technologies. 

Currently employed as a QA Engineer working on the North Dakota MMIS App. Rigorous testing, manual and automated with Selenium and playing around with complex SQL Queries is a small part of my job. It’s been a wonderful learning experience learning the inside outs of MMIS.

On the side, I am building a fully functional E-Commerce website (FlipCart) with React.js, incorporating a back end to store data and using Hooks and Redux to easily manage States of my App and it’s components!
